= QueryHash

A QueryHash is a Hash that provides open access much like
an OpenHash, but it limits readers to query methods (i.e.
method ending in ?-marks).

  require 'hashery/queryhash'

  q = QueryHash.new
  q.a = 1
  q.b = 2
  q.a?.assert == 1
  q.b?.assert == 2

Writers always use Symbols for entry keys.

  q.assert == { :a=>1, :b=>2 }

A QueryHash is compatible with Ruby's standard Hash in
every other respect.
