description:
  Facets is the single largest collection of core extension methods
  available for the Ruby programming language.
  Facets is a large collection of core extension methods
  and standard additions for the Ruby programming language.
  The core extensions are unique by virtue of thier atomicity.
  Methods are stored in small, tightly related collections,
  allowing for highly granular control of requirements.
  The modules include a variety of useful classes, mixins
  and microframeworks, from the Functor to a complete
  Annotations system.
